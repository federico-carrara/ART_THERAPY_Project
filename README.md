# ART_THERAPY_Project

Analysis of data from the Art Therapy project for patients affected by Parkinson's disease.

Art Therapy is a novel and very promising methodology to slow down the course of the disease. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the therapy when applied to patients at different stages of Parkinson's. The data under analysis are the outcomes of different tests used to assess the cognitive, motor, and visuospatial abilities of approximately 50 patients, measured before and after the therapy (baseline and follow-up scores). 

In the Jupyter notebooks reported in this repository the following tasks are performed:
- Dataset preparation
- Missing data imputation
- Feature importance analysis in order to identify the most significant features at baseline that may influence the success of the treatment
- Classification of subjects based on their BL features (still in progress as we expect to collect new data...)

The project is still in progress, as researchers expect to obtain new data from new subjects.
